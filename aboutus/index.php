<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<p>You've somehow ended up here at CriticalWire.com, so I might as well tell you a little bit about it. I bought the domain criticalwire.com in mid 2007 and have been hooked on coding for websites ever since. The site has gone from forum, to pure HTML, to what it is today: a fully coded website in PHP, JQuery and a complete MySQL backend.</p><br /><br />
<p>As for now, CriticalWire is a place where I can post my thoughts and news on things that interest me. If you have any insight or comments, feel free to throw me an email: brooks@criticalwire.com</p>
